**Option B**

Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

In Hyginus, Chpater 30, Section 1, we are told that Hercules strangled two serpents sent by juno. When we look at the work of art, we can see that visisual is very similar to the story since Hercules has two serpents in his hands that he is strangling. One difference is that we do not know that Juno sent the snakes by just looking at the visual. Instead, we have to read the story to udnerstand who sent the snakes.
