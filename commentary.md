**Option B**

Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

In Hyginus, Chapter 30, Section 1, we are told *Infans cum esset, dracones duos duabus manibus necauit, quos Iuno miserat, unde primigenius est dictus.* Here, the sentence is saying that Hercules strangled two serpents sent by Juno. The sculpture of Hercules (linked below) is very similar to the story. For example, in the sculpture, we can see that Hercules has two serpents in his hands that he is strangling, just like he does in the story. One difference between the sculpture and the story is that one could not know that Juno sent the snakes by just looking at the sculpture. Instead, we have to read the story to understand who sent the snakes.
